### Overview
An important element of data-driven decisions is the ability to visually communicate your data and interpretations. As “big data” and data analysis become more important yet more complex, it is even more important to understand the basic principles of data visualization. 

### Purpose
This assignment aligns with the second course objective: create visualizations using R. 

### Dataset and Submission Instructions
The dataset UMDBasketball2020.csv contains information of Maryland Terrapins school history from 1923 to 2019. The data was originally scraped from Sports-Reference.com.  In this assignment, we will use this data set to study the team’s overall wins and coaches’ performance. A data dictionary can be found at the end of word document.

### Visualization Guidelines
Make sure to change the axis titles, chart titles, colors, size, font, legend locations etc. if needed. Categories should be in a meaningful order, if appropriate. Also, format the grid lines and data series appropriately to enhance the clarity of the graph. Remember to write an informative title with some insights. Note that the outcome variable is typically on the y-axis (vertical axis).

Explore the distribution of overall wins


```{r}
ggplot(umd_data, aes(y=OverallWins,x=0))+
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour="red",
        outlier.fill="red",
        outlier.size=3)+
  geom_jitter(width=0.05)+
  annotate("text",x=0.1:0.4,y=0.1,label="There are No outliers and the median is 16")+
  labs(title="Box Plot of overall Wins",
       annotate = "",
       y="No of wins",x="UMD Basketball Team")+
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(face="bold",margin = margin(t = 10)), # x-axis title is too close to axis ticks labels.
        axis.text = element_text(face="bold",size=10),
        plot.caption = element_text(face="italic"),
        plot.title = element_text(size=12),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color="grey95"))



```

Explore the correlations between numeric variables
a)	Create a correlations heat map for the following variables: OverallWins, ConferenceWins, SRS, SOS, PTS, and Opponents PTS. 

b)	Improve your chart to make it clear and ready for presenting to your readers. 

```{r}
numeric_variables <- umd_data %>%
  select(OverallWins, ConferenceWins, SRS,SOS,`Opponents PTS`)

data_hm <- numeric_variables %>% 
  filter_at(vars(SRS, SOS,`Opponents PTS`), all_vars(!is.na(.))) %>%
  cor() %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  rownames_to_column(var = "Var1") %>% 
  pivot_longer(OverallWins:`Opponents PTS`, 
               names_to="Variable", values_to="corr")
heatmap <- data_hm %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Var1, y=Variable, fill=corr)) + 
  geom_tile()
heatmap

heatmap1 <- heatmap +
  scale_fill_gradient2(name="Correlation",midpoint = 0,
                       low="red4", mid="white", high = "blue4")
heatmap1

# Improve the chart
heatmap1 + 
  labs(title = "Correlation Heat map for OverallWins ConferenceWins SRS SOS OpponentPTS") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        axis.title = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_text(face="bold",size=10),
        plot.title = element_text(face="bold",size=10))

```

c)	Which variables are positively correlated with overall wins? Which variable is most correlated with overall wins?  

    #### Answer here: Overall Wins is highly(most) correlated with SRS.Conference Wins,SRS,SOS are positively correlated with Overall wins

 Explore the relationship between overall wins and conference wins
a)	Create a scatter plot of the overall wins and conference wins; use different colors or shapes to denote difference conferences (ACC, Big Ten and Southern)
b)	Add a single trend line to the chart. Hint: the mapping of color or shape needs to be created in the geom function instead of ggplot.

c)	Improve your chart to make it clear and ready for presenting to your readers.

```{r}

umd_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=OverallWins,y=ConferenceWins,col=Conf)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, col='darkred',lty = 2) + 
  labs(title="Scatter plot for Overall wins and Conference Wins",
       x="OverallWins", y="ConferenceWins") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10)), 
        axis.text = element_text(face="bold",size=10),
        plot.caption = element_text(face="italic"),
        plot.title = element_text(size=12),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color="grey95"),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank())+
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,40,5))


####d)	What pattern do you notice? 

    #### Answer here: On average playing in the ACC resulted in higher overall wins and lower conference wins and the vice versa is true for Southern


```



### Explore the change of overall wins over years.
b)	Highlight the point with the highest wins (Hint: you could use the geom_point functio); add a data label above the point to show the value. 
c)	Add a vertical line at x = 2010. 
d)	Improve your chart to make it clear and ready for presenting to your readers. 



```{r echo=TRUE}
umd_data$Year <- as.character(as.numeric(umd_data$Year)) 
umd_data <- umd_data %>%  
  mutate(year = as.Date(Year,"%Y"))

OverallWins_chart <- umd_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y = OverallWins,group=1)) +
  geom_line(col='blue2', lwd=1.3) 
OverallWins_chart
